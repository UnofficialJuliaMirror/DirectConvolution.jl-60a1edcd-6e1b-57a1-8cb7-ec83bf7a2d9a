#+TITLE: Direct Convolution Package


This package goal is to compute convolution products 

\begin{equation}
\gamma[k]=\sum\limits_{i\in\Omega^\alpha}\alpha[i]\beta[k+\lambda i],\text{ with }\lambda\in\mathbb{Z}^*
\end{equation}

using direct (no FFT) methods. This can be helpful for short filters.
