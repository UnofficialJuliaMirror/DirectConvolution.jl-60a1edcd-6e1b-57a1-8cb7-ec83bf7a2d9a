#+TITLE: Direct Convolution Package

This package goal is to compute convolution products 

\begin{equation*}
\gamma[k]=\sum\limits_{i\in\Omega^\alpha}\alpha[i]\beta[k+\lambda i],\text{ with }\lambda\in\mathbb{Z}^*
\end{equation*}

using direct (no FFT) methods. This can be helpful for short filters.

*Note:* if you directly read this doc from GitHub, it is better to
clone this repo and to browse it locally 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
firefox docs/index.html
#+END_SRC

*Caveat:* this package is still in early development... This is the
first package I publicly release. For documentation it uses
=J4Org.jl=, a package I am currently developing to document code using
Emacs Org-mode.

This package is based on my old posts:
